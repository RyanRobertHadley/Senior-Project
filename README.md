# Senior-Project
This project was done as my senior capstone project for the Le Moyne College Computer Science Program.
This was completed by my partner Kristine Carlsen and I according to the specifications of the Syracuse Spiritual Renewal Center.
Users of the application are asked to fill out a form on google forms to make a reservation for one of the meeting rooms at the center.
The JavaScript accesses this form submission and checks for any conflicts with the hours of the center or availibility of the room. It then will return an HTML page with the results of their request. The HTML page then allows the user to make another choice or view openings in a callendar format.
